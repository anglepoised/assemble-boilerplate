assemble-boilerplate
====================

[ ![Codeship Status for bearandrocket/assemble-boilerplate](https://codeship.io/projects/9c890ac0-11eb-0132-b5cc-6e89f715e7d6/status)](https://codeship.io/projects/33158)

A simple boilerplate for doing all the standard static site things (lint, build, optimise, test etc) with [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) (currently [pre-0.6.0](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/issues/551)), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and (ideally) [Codeship](http://codeship.io/) or another CI service.

Borrows heavily from a Grunt workflow put together by [Richard Hallows](http://richardhallows.com/). Thanks, Rich.
