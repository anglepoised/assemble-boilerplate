assemble-boilerplate
====================

[![deprecated](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/deprecated.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

A simple boilerplate for doing all the standard static site things (lint, build, optimise, test etc) with [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) (currently [pre-0.6.0](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/issues/551)), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and (ideally) [Codeship](http://codeship.io/) or another CI service.

Borrows heavily from a Grunt workflow put together by [Richard Hallows](https://github.com/jeddy3). Thanks, Rich.
